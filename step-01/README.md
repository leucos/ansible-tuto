# Ansible tutorial: Inventory

Before continuing, you need an inventory file. The default place for such a
file is  `/etc/ansible/hosts`. However, you can configure ansible to look
somewhere else, use an environment variable (`ANSIBLE_INVENTORY`), or use the `-i`
flag in ansible commands an provide the inventory path.

We've created an inventory file for you in the directory that looks like this:

```bash
host0 ansible_host=192.168.33.10 ansible_user=root
host1 ansible_host=192.168.33.11 ansible_user=root
host2 ansible_host=192.168.33.12 ansible_user=root
```

`ansible_host` is a special _variable_ that sets the IP ansible will use when
trying to connect to this host. It's not necessary here if you use the
vagrant-hostmaster gem. Also, you'll have to change the IPs if you have set up
your own virtual machines with different addresses.

`ansible_user` is another special _variable_ that tells ansible to
connect as this user when using ssh. By default ansible would use your
current username, or use another default provided in ~/.ansible.cfg
(`remote_user`).

## Testing

Now that ansible is installed, let's check everything works properly.

```bash
ansible -m ping all -i step-01/hosts
```

What ansible will try to do here is just executing the `ping` module (more on
modules later) on each host.

The output should look like this:

```json
host0 | success >> {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

host1 | success >> {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

host2 | success >> {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

Good! All 3 hosts are alive and kicking, and ansible can talk to them.

Now head to next step in directory [step-02](https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-02).
