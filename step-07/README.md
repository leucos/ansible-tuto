Ansible tutorial
================

Using conditionals
------------------

We've installed apache, pushed our virtualhost and restarted the server. But we want 
to revert things to a stable state if something goes wrong.

# Reverting when things go wrong

A word of warning: there's no magic here. The previous error was not ansible's fault. It's not a backup 
system, and it can't rollback all things. It's your job to make sure your playbooks are safe. Ansible 
just doesn't know how to revert the effects of `a2ensite awesome-app`.

But if we care to do it, it's well within our reach.

As said, when a task fails, processing stops... unless we accept failure (and
we [should](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/geremiah)). This is what we'll do: continue 
processing if there is a failure but only to revert what we've done.


    - hosts: web
      tasks:
        - name: Installs apache web server
          apt: pkg=apache2 state=installed update_cache=true

        - name: Push future default virtual host configuration
          copy: src=files/awesome-app dest=/etc/apache2/sites-available/ mode=0640

        - name: Activates our virtualhost
          command: a2ensite awesome-app

        - name: Check that our config is valid
          command: apache2ctl configtest
          register: result
          ignore_errors: True

        - name: Rolling back - Restoring old default virtualhost
          command: a2ensite default
          when: result|failed

        - name: Rolling back - Removing out virtualhost
          command: a2dissite awesome-app
          when: result|failed

        - name: Rolling back - Ending playbook
          fail: msg="Configuration file is not valid. Please check that before re-running the playbook."
          when: result|failed

        - name: Deactivates the default virtualhost
          command: a2dissite default

        - name: Deactivates the default ssl virtualhost
          command: a2dissite default-ssl

        notify:
            - restart apache

      handlers:
        - name: restart apache
          service: name=apache2 state=restarted

The `register` keyword records output from the `apache2ctl configtest` command (exit 
status, stdout, stderr, ...), and `when: result|failed` checks if the registered variable 
(`result`) contains a failed status.

Here we go:

    $ ansible-playbook -i step-07/hosts -l host1.example.org step-07/apache.yml

    PLAY [web] *********************

    ...ignoring

    TASK: [Rolling back - Restoring old default virtualhost] ********************* 
    changed: [host1.example.org]

    TASK: [Rolling back - Removing out virtualhost] ********************* 
    changed: [host1.example.org]

    TASK: [Rolling back - Ending playbook] ********************* 
    failed: [host1.example.org] => {"failed": true}
    msg: Configuration file is not valid. Please check that before re-running the playbook.

    FATAL: all hosts have already failed -- aborting

    PLAY RECAP ********************* 
    host1.example.org              : ok=7    changed=4    unreachable=0    failed=1    

Seemed to work as expected. Let's try to restart apache to see if it really worked:

    $ ansible -i step-07/hosts -m service -a 'name=apache2 state=restarted' host1.example.org
    host1.example.org | success >> {
        "changed": true, 
        "name": "apache2", 
        "state": "started"
    }

Ok, now our apache is safe from misconfiguration here.

While this sounds like a lot of work, it isn't. Remember you can use variables
almost  everywhere, so it's easy to make this a general playbook for apache,
and use it everywhere to deploy your virtualhosts. Write it once, use it
everywhere. We'll do that in step 9 but for now, let's deploy our web site
using git in [step-08](https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-08).
