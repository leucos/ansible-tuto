Migrating to roles!
--------------------

Now that our playbook is done, let's refactor everything! We'll replace
our plays with roles. Roles are just a new way of organizing files but
bring interesting features. I won't go into great lengths here, since
they're listed in
[Ansible's documentation](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/playbooks_roles.html#id5),
but my favorite is probably roles dependencies: role B can depend on
another role A. Thus, when applying role B, role A will automatically be
applied too. We'll see this in the [next
chapter](https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-13),
but for now, let's refactor out playbook to use roles.

# Roles structures

Roles add a bit of "magic" to Ansible: they assume a specific file
organization. While there is a suggested layout regarding roles, you can
organize things the way you want using includes. However, role's
conventions help building modular playbooks, and housekeeping will be
much simpler.
Rubyists would call this "convention over configuration".

The file layout for roles looks like this:

    roles
      |
      |_some_role
           |
           |_files
           |   |
           |   |_file1
           |   |_...
           |
           |_template
           |   |
           |   |_template1.j2
           |   |_...
           |
           |_tasks
           |   |
           |   |_main.yml
           |   |_some_other_file.yml
           |   |_ ...
           |
           |_handlers
           |    |
           |    |_main.yml
           |    |_some_other_file.yml
           |    |_ ...
           |
           |_vars
           |    |
           |    |_main.yml
           |    |_some_other_file.yml
           |    |_ ...
           |
           |_meta
                |
                |_main.yml
                |_some_other_file.yml
                |_ ...

Quite simple.
The files named `main.yml` are not mandatory. However, when they exist,
roles will add them to the play automatically.
You can use this file to include other tasks, handlers, ... in the play.
We'll see that in a minute.

Note that there is also a `vars` and a `meta` directory. `vars` is used
when you want to put a bunch of variables regarding the roles. However,
I don't like setting vars in roles (or plays) directly. I think variables
belong to configuration, while plays are the structure. In other words,
I see plays and roles as a factory, and data as inputs to this factory.
So I really prefer to have "data" (e.g. variables) outside roles and
play. This way, I can share my roles more easily, without worrying about
exposing too much about my servers. But that's just a personal
preference. Ansible just lets you do it the way you want.

The `meta` directory is where you can add dependencies, and it's really
a neat feature. We'll see that later.

Note that roles lay in the `roles` directory, which is also cool since
it will reduce top level ansible playbook clutter.

# Creating the Apache role

Ok, now that we know the required layout, we can create our apache role
from our apache playbook.

The steps required are really simple:
- create the roles directory and apache role layout
- extract the apache handler into `roles/apache/handlers/main.yml`
- move the apache configuration file `awesome-app` into
  `roles/apache/files/`
- create a role playbook

## Creating the role layout

This is what has been done to convert step-11 apache files into a role:

    mkdir -p step-12/roles/apache/{tasks,handlers,files}

Now we need to copy the tasks from `apache.yml` to `main.yml`, so this
file looks like this:

    - name: Updates apt cache
      apt: update_cache=true

    - name: Installs necessary packages
      apt: pkg={{ item }} state=latest
      with_items:
        - apache2
        - libapache2-mod-php5
        - git

    ...

    - name: Deactivates the default ssl virtualhost
      command: a2dissite default-ssl
      notify:
        - restart apache

The file is not fully reproduced, but it is exactly the content of
`apache.yml` between `tasks:` and `handlers:`.

Note that we also have to remove references to `files/` and `templates/`
directories in tasks. Since we're using the roles structure, Ansible
will look for them in the right directories.

## Extracting the handler

We can extract the handlers part and create
`step-12/roles/apache/handlers/main.yml`:

    - name: restart apache
      service: name=apache2 state=restarted

## Moving the configuration file

As simple as:

    cp step-11/files/awesome-app step-12/roles/apache/files/

At this point, the apache role is fully working, but we need a way to
invoke it.

## Create a role playbook

Let's create a top level playbook that we'll use to map hosts and hosts
groups to roles. We'll call it `site.yml`, since our goal is to have our
site-wide configuration in it. While we're at it, we'll include
`haproxy` in it too:

    - hosts: web
      roles:
        - { role: apache }

    - hosts: haproxy
      roles:
        - { role: haproxy }

That wasn't too hard. 

Now let's create the haproxy role:

    mkdir -p step-12/roles/haproxy/{tasks,handlers,templates}
    cp step-11/templates/haproxy.cfg.j2 step-12/roles/haproxy/templates/

then extract the handler, and remove reference to `templates/`.

We can try out our new playbook with:

    ansible-playbook -i step-12/hosts step-12/site.yml

If eveything goes well, we should end up with a happy "PLAY RECAP" like
this one:

    host0.example.org          : ok=4    changed=1    unreachable=0 failed=0
    host1.example.org          : ok=10   changed=8    unreachable=0 failed=0
    host2.example.org          : ok=10   changed=8    unreachable=0 failed=0

Note that we changed the haproxy role a bit: we also install socat for
future fun.

This concludes our migration to roles. It was quite easy, and adds a
bunch of features to our playbook that we'll use in a future step.

But for now, we'll see how we can deploy firewall rules for our cluster
in [step-13](https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-13)
chapter about "Deploying firewall rules". In this chapter, we'll use
role dependencies to build our systems.
