Ansible tutorial
================

This tutorial presents ansible step-by-step. You'll need to have a (virtual or
physical) machine to act as an ansible node. A vagrant environment is provided for 
going through this tutorial.

Ansible is a configuration management software that let's you control and
configure nodes from  another machine. What makes it different from other
management software is that ansible  uses (potentially existing) SSH
infrastructure, while others (chef, puppet, ...) need a specific PKI
infrastructure to be set-up.

Ansible also emphasises push mode, where configuration is pushed from a master
machine (a master machine is only a machine where you can SSH to nodes from) to
nodes, while most other CM typically do it the other way around (nodes pull
their config at times from a master machine).

This mode is really interesting since you do not need to have a 'publicly'
accessible 'master' to be able to configure remote nodes: it's the nodes
that need to be accessible (we'll see later that 'hidden' nodes can pull their
configuration too!), and most of the time they are.

# Prerequisites for Ansible

You need the following python modules on your machine (the machine you run ansible 
on) 
- python-yaml
- python-jinja2

On Debian/Ubuntu run:
``sudo apt-get install python-yaml python-jinja2 python-paramiko python-crypto``

We're also assuming you have a keypair in your ~/.ssh directory.

# Installing Ansible

## From source

Ansible devel branch is always usable, so we'll run straight from a git checkout.
You might need to install git for this (`sudo apt-get install git` on Debian/Ubuntu).

```bash
git clone git://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
cd ./ansible
```

At this point, we can load the ansible environment:

```bash
source ./hacking/env-setup
```

## From a deb package

When running from an installed package, this is absolutely not necessary. If
you prefer running from a debian package ansible, provides a `make target` to
build it. You need a few packages to build the deb:

```bash
sudo apt-get install make fakeroot cdbs python-support
git clone git://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
cd ./ansible
make deb
sudo dpkg -i ../ansible_1.1_all.deb (version may vary)
```

We'll assume you're using the deb packages in the rest of this tutorial.

# Cloning the tutorial

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto.git
cd ansible-tuto
```

# Using Vagrant with the tutorial

It's highly recommended to use Vagrant to follow this tutorial. If you don't have 
it already, setting up should be quite easy and is described in [step-00/README.md](https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-00/README.md).

If you wish to proceed without Vagrant (not recommended!), go straight to
[step-01/README.md](https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-01).

## Contents

[Terminology](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/glossary.html):
 - [command or action](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_adhoc.html): [ansible module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/modules.html) like just a shell command. Intro in [step-02](https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-02).
 - task: it's combine an action (a module and its arguments) with a name and optionally some other keywords (like looping directives).
 - [playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_intro.html): an yaml file contains roles executed in sequence, and eventually individual tasks. Intro in [step-04](https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-04).
 - [role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_roles.html): an organisational unit grouping tasks together in order to install a piece of software. Intro in [step-12](https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-12).

(and sorry if I forgot anyone)

I've been using Ansible almost since it's birth, but I learned a lot in
the process of writing it. If you want to jump in, it's a great way to
learn, feel free to add your contributions.

The chapters being written live in the
[writing](https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/writing) branch.

If you have ideas on topics that would require a chapter, please open a
PR.

I'm also open on pairing for writing chapters. Drop me a note if you're
interested.

If you make changes or add chapters, please fill the `test/expectations`
file and run the tests (`test/run.sh`).
See the `test/run.sh` file for (a bit) more information.

When adding a new chapter (e.g. `step-NN`), please issue:

```bash
cd step-99
ln -sf ../step-NN/{hosts,roles,site.yml,group_vars,host_vars} .
```

For typos, grammar, etc... please send a PR for the master branch
directly.

Thank you!
