# Ansible tutorial: Grouping hosts

Hosts in inventory can be grouped arbitrarily. For instance, you could have a
`debian` group, a `web-servers` group, a `production` group, etc...

```ini
[debian]
host0
host1
host2
```

This can even be expressed shorter:

```ini
[debian]
host[0:2]
```

If you wish to use child groups, just define a `[groupname:children]` and add
child groups in it. For instance, let's say we have various flavors of linux
running, we could organize our inventory like this:

```ini
[ubuntu]
host0

[debian]
host[1:2]

[linux:children]
ubuntu
debian
```

Grouping, of course, leverages configuration mutualization.

## Setting variables

You can assign variables to hosts in several places: inventory file, host vars
files, group vars files, etc...

I usually set most of my variables in group/host vars files (more on that
later). However, I often use some variables directly in the inventory file,
such as `ansible_host` which sets the IP address for the host. Ansible by
default resolves hosts' name when it attempts to connect via SSH. But when
you're bootstrapping a host, it might not have its definitive IP address yet.
`ansible_host` comes in handy here.

When using `ansible` or `ansible-playbook` command, variables can also be set
with `--extra-vars` (or `-e`) command line switch as a whitespace-separated
list of `key=val` pairs (it's possible to use the switch multiple times for
each variable initialization). We'll talk about `ansible-playbook` in the next
step.

`ansible_port`, as you can guess, has the same function regarding the SSH port
ansible will try to connect at.

```ini
[ubuntu]
host0 ansible_host=192.168.0.12 ansible_port=2222
```

Ansible will look for additional variables definitions in group and host
variable files. These files will be searched in directories `group_vars` and
`host_vars`, below the directory where the main inventory file is located.

The files will be searched by name. For instance, using the previously
mentioned inventory file, `host0` variables will be searched in those files:

- `group_vars/linux`
- `group_vars/ubuntu`
- `host_vars/host0`

It doesn't matter if those files do not exist, but if they do, ansible will
use them.

Now that we know the basics of modules, inventories and variables, let's
explore the real power of Ansible with playbooks.
