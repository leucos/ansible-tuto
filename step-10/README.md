Ansible tutorial
================

Templates
---------

We'll use the `haproxy` as loadbalancer. Of course, install is just like we
did for apache. But now configuration is a bit more tricky since we need to list 
all web servers in haproxy's configuration. How can we do that?

# HAProxy configuration template

Ansible uses [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/), a templating engine for Python. 
When you write Jinja2 templates, you can use any variable defined by Ansible.

For instance, if you want to output the inventory_name of the host the template is 
currently built for, you just can write `{{ inventory_hostname }}` in the Jinja template.

Or if you need the IP of the first ethernet interface (which ansible knows thanks 
to the `setup` module), you just write: `{{ ansible_eth1['ipv4']['address'] }}`
in your template.

Jinja2 templates also support conditionals, for-loops, etc...

Let's make a `templates/` directory and create a Jinja template inside. We'll
call  it `haproxy.cfg.j2`. We use the `.j2` extension by convention, to make
it obvious that this  is a Jinja2 template, but this is not necessary.

```jinja
global
    daemon
    maxconn 256

defaults
    mode http
    timeout connect 5000ms
    timeout client 50000ms
    timeout server 50000ms

listen cluster
    bind {{ ansible_eth1['ipv4']['address'] }}:80
    mode http
    stats enable
    balance roundrobin
{% for backend in groups['web'] %}
    server {{ hostvars[backend]['ansible_hostname'] }} {{ hostvars[backend]['ansible_eth1']['ipv4']['address'] }} check port 80
{% endfor %}
    option httpchk HEAD /index.php HTTP/1.0
```

We have many new things going on here. 

First, `{{ ansible_eth1['ipv4']['address'] }}` will be replaced by the 
IP of the load balancer on eth1. 

Then, we have a loop. This loop is used to build the backend servers list.
It will loop over every host listed in the `[web]` group (and put this host in the 
`backend` variable). For each of the hosts it will render a line using host's facts. 
All hosts' facts are exposed in the `hostvars` variable, so it's easy to access another 
host variables (like its hostname or in this case IP).

We could have written the host list by hand, since we have only 2 of them. But
we're hoping that the server will be very successful, and that we'll need a
hundred of them. Thus, adding servers to the configuration or swapping some
out boils down to adding or removing hosts from the `[web]` group. 

# HAProxy playbook

We've done the most difficult part of the job. Writing a playbook to install and 
configure HAproxy is a breeze:

```yaml
- hosts: haproxy
  tasks:
    - name: Installs haproxy load balancer
      apt: pkg=haproxy state=installed update_cache=yes

    - name: Pushes configuration
      template: src=templates/haproxy.cfg.j2 dest=/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg mode=0640 owner=root group=root
      notify:
        - restart haproxy

    - name: Sets default starting flag to 1
      lineinfile: dest=/etc/default/haproxy regexp="^ENABLED" line="ENABLED=1"
      notify:
        - restart haproxy 

  handlers:
    - name: restart haproxy
      service: name=haproxy state=restarted
```

Looks familiar, isn't it? The only new module here is `template`, which has the same arguments 
as `copy`. We also restrict this playbook to the group `haproxy`.

And now... let's try this out. Since our inventory contains only hosts
necessary for the cluster, we don't need to limit the host list and can even
run both playbooks. Well, to tell the truth, we must run both of them at the same time, since the 
haproxy playbook requires facts _from_ the two webservers.
In step-11 we'll show how to avoid this.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook -i step-10/hosts step-10/apache.yml step-10/haproxy.yml

Looks good. Now head to http://192.168.33.10/ and
see the result. Your cluster is deployed!

you can even peek at HAProxy's statistics at
http://192.168.33.10/haproxy?stats.

Now on to the next chapter about "Variables again", in [step-11](https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-11).
