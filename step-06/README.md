Restarting when config is correct
------------------------------

We've installed apache, pushed our virtualhost and restarted the server.
But what if we wanted the playbook to restart the server only if the config is correct?
Let's do that.

# Bailing out when things go wrong

Ansible has a nifty feature: it will stop all processing if something goes wrong. 
We'll take advantage of this feature to stop our playbook if the config file is not 
valid.

Let's change our `awesome-app` virtual host configuration file and break it:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
      RocumentDoot /var/www/awesome-app

      Options -Indexes

      ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
      TransferLog /var/log/apache2/access.log
    </VirtualHost>

As said, when a task fails, processing stops. So we'll ensure that the
configuration is valid before restarting the server. We also start by adding
our  virtualhost _before_ removing the default virtualhost, so a subsequent
restart (possibly done directly on the server) won't break apache.

Note that we should have done this in the first place. Since we ran our
playbook already, the default virtualhost is already deactivated. Nevermind:
this playbook might be used on other innocent hosts, so let's protect them.

    - hosts: web
      tasks:
        - name: Installs apache web server
          apt: pkg=apache2 state=installed update_cache=true

        - name: Push future default virtual host configuration
          copy: src=files/awesome-app dest=/etc/apache2/sites-available/ mode=0640

        - name: Activates our virtualhost
          command: a2ensite awesome-app

        - name: Check that our config is valid
          command: apache2ctl configtest

        - name: Deactivates the default virtualhost
          command: a2dissite default

        - name: Deactivates the default ssl virtualhost
          command: a2dissite default-ssl

        notify:
            - restart apache

      handlers:
        - name: restart apache
          service: name=apache2 state=restarted

Here we go:

    $ ansible-playbook -i step-06/hosts -l host1.example.org step-06/apache.yml

    PLAY [web] ********************* 

    GATHERING FACTS *********************

    stderr: Syntax error on line 2 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/awesome-app:
    Invalid command 'RocumentDoot', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
    stdout: Action 'configtest' failed.
    The Apache error log may have more information.

    FATAL: all hosts have already failed -- aborting

    PLAY RECAP ********************* 
    host1.example.org              : ok=4    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=1    

As you can see since `apache2ctl` returns with an exit code of 1 when it fails, ansible is 
aware of it and stops processing. Great!

Mmmh, not so great in fact... Our virtual host has been added anyway. Any subsequent 
apache restart will complain about our config and bail out. So we need a way to catch 
failures and revert back.

Let's do that in [step-07](https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-07).
